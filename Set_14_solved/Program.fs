type OrderedListTwo<'a when 'a : equality> =

// Q1

// 1.1
(*
Remember form the text that the list needs to be kept in order in the case we do a operation like;
fron @ rear.reverse.

If we do that on ol1, then we get the original order;
original order: ["Hans"; Brian; Gudrun]

if we reverse rea in ol one and use @ for fron and rear, we get the initial order restored in a list
*)

// 1.2
//We can take the initial value and make three difference orders, using the rear that withholds the invariant.

(*
a
Function takes in an ordered list and uses a pipe to forward it as an argument to a function 
that takes the fron and rear element and computes a new front that is concatenated with the reversed order of the rear. 
The rear list is emptied

b)
Take a orderlist and concatenates the front with a reveresed order of the rear. 
Could have used this in a as well, but let's keep it to explore different ways of doing stuff.
 - Alternative solution is shown below the one presented here

(*
This method includes a helper method that makes the list, we want to use, when applying the
function to each element. 
The idea is to keep the ordering from the initial list, even though, we 
move some element from the fron to the rear.

2.1

part one
This function takes an integer and a list as arguments
Then it performs a pattern matching. 
If the list is empty we return the list adding the incremeneted value from the inital list. At this point the integer could have been incremented severaÃ¦l times 
as seen in the example form the problem description. 

If the list is not empty we take the current head and adds it with the current integer argument and cons it to the recursively list we are building. 

part two. 
the type of this function is: int -> int list -> int list
We need to pass an integer. otherwise, we will encounter a compile error. For this reason, we can not return an empty list
as the return value will always be a list with an integer passed from the function call.

IF ANYONE IS READING THIS. I don't really care about these questions, so my answers are made without to much thought and are probably wrong most of the time. 

part three:
WE are recusively taking out element from a list. At some point this list will be empty
and we will terminate the loop. So, NO

  We take a plot as an argument. At this point a plot can either be a sequence plot tuples or an operator wit potential more sequences of operators
  For each of the tuples we need to expand the recursion so that wer can retrieve all operators.
